# autogluon_bike_sharing_prediction
 
This is an entry for a Kaggle competition that was created as part as part of the AWS Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree. 

## Overview

This project sought to build an algorithm to enter in the [Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). A full project overview can be found at the link above. The competition uses data from Capital Bikeshare to forecast the usage of the city bikeshare system. 

## Methodology

Using the AutoGluon framework I built a baseline model, then used feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve upon the initial model.
